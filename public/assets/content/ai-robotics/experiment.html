            <p>Experimenters construct models of systems and test whether they can predict new behaviors accurately. Models and measurements have been used extensively in various domains in AI, and one significant family of such models are <b>neural networks</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Neural Network Models</b> lay at the core of <b>deep learning</b>, a wide collection of techniques for <b>machine learning</b> in which hypotheses are expressed as complex algebraic circuits with adjustable connection strengths.</p>
            <p>The word "deep" signifies that the circuits are typically organized into a plethora of layers, thus the computation path from input to output will have a high number of steps, allowing variables to interact in complex ways.</p>
            <p>This, in turn, means that these <b>models</b> will be sufficiently expressive to capture the complexity of real-world data for many significant learning problems.</p>
            <p><b>Deep learning</b> is widely applied in visual object recognition, machine translation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image synthesis, reinforcement learning, etc.</p>

            <p>The most basic type of <b>neural network model</b> is the <b>Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)</b>. A feedforward network has connections in only one direction, forming therefore a directed acyclic graph with designated input and output nodes. Each node computes a function depending on its inputs, passing the results to its successors in the network.</p>
            <p>A simple visual way of understanding it would be:</p>

            <div class="img-center">
                <img src="../assets/content/ai-robotics/img/neuralnetwork.png" alt="Neural Network">
            </div>

            <p>The picture above depicts a neural network consisting of three layers (an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer) tasked with the job of finding the price (\(y\)).</p>
            <p>Each node in the hidden layer takes as input all of the four input features. However, rather than defining ourselves what function each hidden unit represents, the neural network is capable of deciding what it wants the node to be.</p>
            <p>Neural networks are therefore remarkable, when given input-output pairs (\(x\), \(y\)), at figuring out functions that accurately map from \(x\) to \(y\). Networks with multiple hidden layers are known as <b>deep neural networks</b>.</p>

            <h3>Matrix Representation</h3>
            <p>Representing a neural network as a matrix is an efficient way of exploring the relationships between the nodes of the network, as it allows us to apply mathematical techniques.</p>
            <p>A simple example to begin to understand how we might represent it is that of solving a <b>binary classification</b> problem through the use of the <b>logistic regression learning algorithm</b>.</p>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Let's consider the following problem: given an image, we want our neural network to determine whether or not it is a picture of a cat.</p>

            <div class="img-center">
                <img src="../assets/content/ai-robotics/img/cat.png" alt="Cat">
            </div>

            <div class="flex justify-between">
                <div class="w-3/5">
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
                        <li>The input layer will be represented as a feature vector \( x \). Let's say the image will be stored in three 64x64 separate matrices, corresponding to Red, Green, and Blue, with each cell value representing the pixel intensity.</li>
                        <li>As it is a binary classification problem, the output will be either 1 (it is a cat) or 0 (it isn't a cat).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The feature vector will look as depicted in the image below.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="img-center">
                    <img src="../assets/content/ai-robotics/img/cat2.png" alt="Feature Vector">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Given an input feature vector \(x\), the logistic regression algorithm will be able to give us an estimate of what the output might be: \( \hat{y} = P(y=1|x) \) will represent the probability that the output is 1 given \(x\).</p>

            <h3>Activation Function</h3>
            <p>An <b>activation function</b> is applied to the output of each neuron and determines whether a neuron should be activated or not. Its parameters are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Weight</b>: Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the signal passing through that connection.</li>
                <li><b>Bias</b>: Allows each neuron to adjust its threshold for activation. For example, when analyzing an image, without bias, a particular neuron might only activate if certain strong features (edges, shapes) are detected, while with an added bias, it will activate even when the features are less prominent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given \( n_{x} \), the number of features in the input, we define \( w \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{x}} \) and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \).</p>
            <p>The output of the neuron will be \( \hat{y} = \sigma(w^{T}x + b) \).</p>

            <p>The sigmoid function is used as opposed to the linear function \( w^{T}x + b \) as it will only render values between 0 and 1, which aligns with how probabilities are defined.</p>
            <p>The formula for the sigmoid function is: \( \sigma = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \).</p>
            <p>If the value of \( z \) is very large, the value of \( e^{-z} \) will tend to zero and therefore the output of the function will be 1.</p>
            <p>If the value of \( z \) is small or a large negative value, the output of the function will be 0.</p>
            <p>Below, the sigmoid function is represented.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Above was described the process of <b>forward propagation</b>. The neural network will then go on through <b>backward propagation</b>: it will compare its output against what it was instructed that the output should be, then go back and adjust its weights accordingly. By repeatedly performing this process, the neural network learns to make more accurate predictions.</p>

            <p>Besides <b>Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)</b>, other important types of <b>neural network models</b> are and tasks at which they excel are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</b>: Processing visual data</li>
                <li><b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</b>: Processing sequential data, such as audio or text</li>
                <li><b>Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)</b>: Tasks where remembering long-term information is crucial, for example accurately translate when previous context from the text is needed</li>
                <li><b>Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)</b>: Similar to LSTMs, but more efficient for shorter sequences; e.g., useful for predicting stock prices based on historical data</li>
                <li><b>Autoencoders</b>: Data compression, de-noising, dimensionality reduction</li>
                <li><b>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b>: Generating realistic images, data augmentation, creative tasks</li>
                <li><b>Transformers</b>: Capable of processing entire sequences at once, they're highly effective for language-related tasks</li>
            </ul>
