    <p>Databases and Information retrieval relate to all other fields of Computer Science because of the necessity of storing information properly.</p>
    <p>Here are a couple of fields that related to DB and IR:</p>

    <br/>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Software Engineering </b>: Databases and information retrieval systems are
            essential components of software applications. Software engineers often design,
            develop, and integrate database systems and information retrieval functionalities
            into software products to manage and access data efficiently.
        </li>

        <br/>

        <li>
            <b>Algorithms and Data Structures </b>: Databases rely on algorithms and data structures
            for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
        </li>
    </ul>
