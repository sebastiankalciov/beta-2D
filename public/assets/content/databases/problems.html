    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Protection of data against unauthorized access</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information are more occurred with the increase of
        data stored in databases. Some of the most popular threats are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL Injection</li>
        <li>Excessive Privilege Abuse</li>
        <li>Exposure of backup data</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-800">SQL Injection</h1>
    <p>
        In an SQL injection attack, the author typically inserts (or ”injects”) unauthorized database
        information into a vulnerable SQL data string.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using SQL injection, attackers can gain unlimited access to an entire database
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Solution</h1>
    <p>
        Three techniques can be combined to effectively combat SQL injection:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intrusion Prevention Technology (IPS)</li>
        <li>Request Access Control</li>
        <li>Event Correlation</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Excessive Privilege Abuse</h1>
    <p>
        When users (or applications) have access privileges to a database that exceeds the requirements of
        their professional function, they may abuse these privileges for malicious purposes.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Solution</h1>
    <p>
        A solution is the elimination of excessive rights. This requires the
        ability to identify excessive rights, i.e. rights that are not necessary for the user
        to perform his function.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Exposure of backup data</h1>
    <p>
        Auxiliary database backup devices are generally not protected against possible attacks.
        As a result, several major security
        breaches have emerged, including theft of hard disks and database backup tapes
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Solution</h1>
    <p>
        All database backups should be encrypted. In fact, some vendors
        have suggested that future database management systems should not support
        the creation of unencrypted backups.
