    <p>When data was first processed by computers, the concept of database was not yet implemented. The requirements for businesses grew larger by time, so computer file processing systems were developed.
        For each requirement, a new database application had to be developed.</p>

    <p>A database application is a program designed to operate on the database (read, write, delete data)</p>

    <p>Because the requirements grew larger, disadvantages of computer file processing systems appeared:
        duplication of data, program data dependence, excessive program maintenance</p>

    <p>To solve these problems, databases come in hand. </p>

    <p>A Database is an organized collection of logically related data</p>
    <p>Databases deal with storing, organizing and structuring information.</p>
