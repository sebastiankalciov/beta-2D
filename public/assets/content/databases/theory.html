    <p>
        The fields of <b class="font-bold text-xl">Databases and Information Retrieval (IR)</b> are foundational to Computer Science,
        each focusing on how data is stored, managed, and accessed, but with distinct goals and methodologies.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Theory</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>When data was first processed by computers, the concept of a database as we know it today
        had not yet been implemented. The requirements for businesses grew larger by time, so computer
        file processing systems were developed to provide a more structured approach to data management.
        These files were often unstructured, with no inherent relationships between different data elements.
        For each requirement, a new database application had to be developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b class="font-bold">A database application </b> is a program designed to operate on the database (read, write, delete data).
    </p>

    <br/>
    <p>However, as the requirements grew even larger, several significant disadvantages of computer file processing systems became clear:
        <ul>
            <li>Duplication of data</li>
            <li>Program data dependence</li>
            <li>Excessive program maintenance</li>
        </ul>
    <p>To solve these problems, databases were developed.</p>
    <br/>
    <p> <b class="font-bold text-xl">A Database </b> is an organized collection of logically related data.
        Databases deal with storing, organizing and structuring information.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">Advantages of Databases:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced duplication of data and inconsistency</li>
        <li>Data independence</li>
        <li>Efficient data retrieval and management: Using query languages like SQL databases
            allow for efficient data retrieval and manipulation</li>
    </ul>
