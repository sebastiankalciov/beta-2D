        When creating a database, it is essential that the database meets the requirements of
        the user. In order to effectively do this, data models are used
    </p>
    <p><b>Data model</b> is graphical system used to capture the nature and relationships among data.</p>
    <p>A simple data model is made up out of entities, attributes and relationships.</p>
    <p>The simplest data modelling representation is the entity-relationship model.</p>

    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze in detail the transactions, forms, displays, and inquiries (database views)
            required by the business functions supported by the database</li>
        <li>Integrate database views into conceptual data model</li>
        <li>Identify data integrity and security requirements, and populate repository</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-neutral-800">Physical database design and definition</h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Define database to DBMS (often generated from repository)</li>
        <li>Decide on physical organization of data</li>
        <li>Design database processing programs</li>
    </ul>

        <b>A Database Management System (DBMS)</b> is a software system that is used to create, maintain,
        and provide controlled access to user databases.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        <b>A Repository </b> is a centralized knowledge base of all data definitions, data relationships,
        screen and report formats, and other system components.
