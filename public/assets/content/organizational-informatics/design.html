        <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiments in information systems are systematically implemented by defining the research question and hypothesis, identifying independent, dependent, and control variables, and selecting an appropriate experimental design such as between-subjects, within-subjects, or factorial design. Participants are carefully chosen, and experimental materials and procedures are developed and tested through pilot studies to ensure clarity and functionality. The experiment is then conducted, with data being collected and systematically analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques. Findings are documented and presented, with careful consideration of ethical aspects such as informed consent, privacy, and obtaining necessary ethical approvals.</p>
