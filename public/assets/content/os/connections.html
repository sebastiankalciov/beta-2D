        <p class="indent-6">
          Operating systems (OS) and networks intertwined with almost every
          other area of computer science. Together, they form the backbone of
          computational environments, ensuring that resources are utilized
          efficiently and communication remains seamless and secure. Here's an
          overview of how they relate to other areas of computer science:
