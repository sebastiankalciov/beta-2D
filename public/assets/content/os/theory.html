        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What Is an Operating System?</h2>
        <p class="indent-6">
          In the 1960s, the definition of an operating system might have been
          the software that controls the hardware. But the landscape of computer
          systems has evolved significantly since then, requiring a richer
          definition. An operating system is software that enables applications
          to interact with a computer's hardware. The software that contains the
          core components of the operating system is called the kernel.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6">
          Operating systems can be found in devices ranging from cell phones and
          automobiles to personal and mainframe computers. In most computer
          systems, a user requests that the computer perform an action (e.g.,
          execute an application or print a document) and the operating system
          manages the software and hardware to produce the desired result.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6">
          Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the
          system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of
          processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources. For
          hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the
          operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the
          computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed
          directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS
          function or is interrupted by it.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Topics of Theory research</h3>
        <p class="indent-6">
          This area deals with control mechanisms that allow multiple resources
          to be efficiently coordinated in computations distributed over many
          computer systems connected by local and wide-area networks.
          Fundamental questions include: How can interfaces be organized so that
          users deal only with abstract versions of resources and not with
          physical details of hardware? What are the principles by which systems
          can be extended in function by repeated application of a small number
          of construction rules? How should distributed computations be
          organized, with the details of network protocols, host locations,
          bandwidths, and resource naming being mostly invisible?
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6">
          Major elements of theory in operating systems include: concurrency
          theory (synchronization, determinacy, and deadlocks); scheduling
          theory; program behavior and memory management theory; network flow
          theory; performance modeling and analysis. Supporting mathematics
          include bin packing, probability, queueing theory, queueing networks,
          communication and information theory, temporal logic, and
          cryptography.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6">
          Operating systems and networking has always been, first and foremost,
          a field of design. This field has yielded efficient standard methods
          including time sharing systems, automatic storage allocators,
          multilevel schedulers, memory managers, hierarchical file systems. It
          has yielded well-known operating systems such as Unix, Multics, Mach,
          VMS, MacOS, OS/2, MS-DOS, and Windows NT. It has produced standard
          utilities including editors, document formatters, compilers, linkers,
          and device drivers. It has produced standard approaches to files and
          file systems. It has produced queueing network modeling and simulation
          packages for evaluating performance of real systems; network
          architectures such as Ethernet, FDDI, token ring nets, SNA, and
          DECNET. It has produced protocol techniques embodied in the US
          Department of Defense protocol suite (TCP/IP), virtual circuit
          protocols, Internet, real time conferencing, and X.25. It has devoted
          considerable attention to security and privacy issues in the Internet.
