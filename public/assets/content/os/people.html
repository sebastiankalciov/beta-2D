          Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie are well known in the field of
          operating systems for their development of the UNIX operating system
          and the C programming language. They have received several awards and
          recognition for their accomplishments, including the ACM Turing Award,
          the National Medal of Technology, the NEC C&C Prize, the IEEE Emmanuel
          Piore Award, the IEEE Hamming Medal, induction into the United States
          National Academy of Engineering and the Bell Labs National Fellowship.
          Ken Thompson attended the University of California at Berkeley, where
          he earned a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science, graduating in 1966.
          After college Thompson worked at Bell Labs, where he eventually joined
          Dennis Ritchie on the Multics project. While working on that project,
          Thompson created the B language that led to Ritchie's C language. The
          Multics project eventually led to the creation of the UNIX operating
          system in 1969. Thompson continued to develop UNIX through the early
          1970s, rewriting it in Ritchie's C programming language.

          Dennis Ritchie attended Harvard University, earning a Bachelor's
          degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in Mathematics. Ritchie went on to work
          at Bell Labs, where he joined Thompson on the Multics project in 1968.
          Ritchie is most recognized for his C language, which he completed in
          1972. Ritchie added some extra capabilities to Thompson's B language
          and changed the syntax to make it easier to use. Within the past 10
          years he has created two new operating systems. Plan 9 and Inferno.
          The Plan 9 system is designed for communication and production
          quality. lnferno is a system intended for advanced networking.

        <p class="indent-6">
          Doug Engelbart invented the computer mouse and was one of the primary
          designers of the original graphical displays and windows. Engelbart's
          background was in electronics. During World War II he worked as an
          electronics technician on a variety of systems including RADAR and
          SONAR. In 1968, at the Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco,
          Engelbart and his coworkers displayed their computer system, NLS
          (oNLine System) which featured Engelbart's computer mouse and a
          graphical interface with windows. This original mouse, called an X-Y
          Position Indicator for a Display Sys tern, had only one button. The
          mouse had two wheels on the bottom, one horizontal and one vertical,
          to detect movement. The mouse and the graphical windows were
          interdependent. Engelbart has dedicated his life to augmenting human
          intellect. His original idea behind the NLS system was to create a
          system that could help people solve problems faster. Engelbart founded
          the Bootstrap Institute to foster worldwide awareness of his mission.
          Today, Engelbart is still working with the Bootstrap Institute. He has
          received recognition for his work including the Lemelson-MIT Prize,
          the National Medal of Technology and induction into the National
          Inventors Hall of Fame.

        <p class="indent-6">
          The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. The Web
          allows computer users to locate and view multimedia-based documents
          (i.e., documents with text, graphics, animation, audio or video) on
          almost any subject. Berners-Lee graduated from Queen's College at
          Oxford University with a degree in Physics in 1976. In 1980 he wrote a
          program called Enquire, which used hypertext links to help him quickly
          navigate the numerous documents in a large project. He entered into a
          fellowship at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1984,
          where he gained experience in communication software for real-time
          networked systems. Berners-Lee invented HTTP (the HyperText Transfer
          Protocol), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and the first World Wide
          Web server and browser in 1989, while working at CERN. He intended the
          Web to be a mechanism for open, available access to all shared
          knowledge and experience. Until 1993, Berners-Lee individually managed
          changes and suggestions for HTTP and HTML, sent from the early Web
          users. By 1994 the Web community had grown large enough that he
          started the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C; www.w3.org) to monitor and
          establish Web technology standards. As director of the organization,
          he actively promotes the principle of freely available information
          accessed by open technologies.

        <p class="indent-6">
          Linus Torvalds was born in 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. As a child he
          taught himself how to program by playing with a Commodore VIC-20. In
          1988 he entered the University of Helsinki to study computer science.
          While there, he wrote a UNIX clone based on Professor Andrew
          Tanenbaum's Minix to run on his new PC. In 1991 he completed the first
          version of the basic Linux kernel, which ran on the Intel 80386
          processor. He distributed Linux under the GNU Public License (GPL) as
          open source code and gladly accepted additions, corrections and free
          programs from other programmers. By 1994 Linux had accrued enough
          applications to be a complete, usable operating system, and version
          1.0 was released. Programmers and professors using UNIX on large
          systems liked Linux because it brought the features and power of UNIX
          to inexpensive desktop systems for free. Linux has become one of the
          largest and best-known open-source developments in computing history
          and has become particularly successful in the server market.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold pt-5">Richard Stallman</h2>
        <img
          class="float-right pl-5 pt-3"
          width="300px"
          src="https://www.freedomology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stallman-alt..jpg" />
        <p class="indent-6">
          Richard Stallman was the original developer of the GNU project,
          started in the 1980s to create free software. Stallman graduated from
          Harvard in 1974 with a degree in Physics. While at Harvard, he worked
          at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. After graduating, he continued
          at the lab, where he and his colleagues worked with shared software.
          The idea was that someone receiving someone else's executable program
          would also receive its source code. This was advantageous because a
          programmer could add more functionality to someone else's program.
          Stallman's specific job was to modify and improve the ITS operating
          system the lab used. However, the lab's new operating system was not
          shared. In 1984 he left the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab to work on
          a new shared operating system, which he called GNU (GNU's Not UNIX).
          As interest in Stallman's GNU project grew, he created the Free
          Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985 to promote free software and
          continue to develop the GNU operating system. Stallman and his
          associates at FSF created a number of GNU programs, including GNU
          Emacs (a text editor), GCC (a C compiler) and GDB (a debugger), to
          name a few. In 1992 Stallman used the Linux kernel to complete his
          system. The system, known as GNU/Linux, is a fully functional
          operating system and includes a variety of programs. Stallman has
          received numerous awards and recognition for his work, including the
          Grace Hopper Award, MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, the Electric
          Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award, the Yuri Rubinksi Award, the Takeda
          Award, election to the National Academy of Engineering and two
          honorary doctorates from the Institute of Technology in Sweden and the
          University of Glasgow.
