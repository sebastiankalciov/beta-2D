        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many useful, practical algorithms have been designed and placed in program libraries -- for example, mathematical software, searching, sorting, random- number generation, textual pattern matching, hashing, graphs, trees, communication network protocols, distributed-data updates, semaphores, deadlock detectors, synchronizers, storage managers, lists, tables, and paging algorithms. Many theoretical results have been translated into useful and practical systems, such as the RSA public key cryptosystem, production-quality compilers, and VLSI circuit layout.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many steps involved in writing a computer program to solve a given problem. The steps go from problem formulation and specification,where we define the problem and understand it's requierments and constraints; to design of the solution, here we need to find the steps that lead to the requierments; to implementation, writing the found solution in code; testing and documentation, to keep track of improvements and aid further research; and finally to evaluation of the solution.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important aspect of an algorithm is the data it's working on and the way we structure it. Optimal data structures can be choosen by understanding their usefulenss, or in cases where is less obvious, via experimentation. Some speceial cases might require us to implement custom data structures.</p>
