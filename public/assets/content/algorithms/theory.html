            <br> Algorithms and data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science, essential for solving computational problems efficiently. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem, while data structures organize and store data to enable efficient access and modification. Together, they form the backbone of software development, allowing for optimized performance and resource management.

        <p> The theory of algorithms encompasses computability theory, computational complexity theory, concurrency theory, probabilistic algorithm theory, database theory, randomized algorithms, pattern-matching algorithms, graph and network algorithms, algebraic algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and cryptography. It is supported by discrete mathematics (graph theory, recursive functions, recurrence relations, combinatorics), calculus, induction, predicate logic, temporal logic (a calculus of time dependent events), semantics, probability, and statistics. </p>

        <p> Moreover, this understanding provides insight into the intrinsic nature of computation, computational problems, and computational problem-solving as well as possible solution techniques independent of programming language, programming paradigm, computer hardware, or other implementation aspects. </p>
