        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experimentation is a vital part of research, especially when attempting to find the characteristics of an algorithm that is too complex to achieve by known theoretical analysis. To evaluate the performance, an algorithm can be applied to various test cases. In the real world testing has gathered information about certain methods such as divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, finite state machine interpreters, stack machine interpreters, heuristic searches, and randomized algorithms. </p>
        <br> Many useful aspects of experimentation are: <p>
