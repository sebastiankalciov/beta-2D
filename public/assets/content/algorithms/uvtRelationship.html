        <p> At UVT, the first experience with Algorithms and Data Structures happens in year I, semester I, where we study the algorithms part of this subject, by implementing numerous algorithms on sorting, but also working with matrixes. In semester II of year I, we get into the Data Structures part, where we study the well known data structures: from linked-lists to binary trees and hash tables. In year two we will have the chance to study Advanced Data Structures that will cover structures such as Binomial heaps, Red-Black trees, String matching (which is closely related to FLAT subject). In year III a discipline connected to ADS is Data Compression Algorithms. As for Masters, there is no dedicated specialization for ADS. Since this discplinie sits at the foundation of any other specialization, it is inevitably part of all Masters programs. </p>

        <p> Knowing the relationship between Algorithms and Data Structure with all other fields, there are not many jobs dedicated to this subject in particular apart from researchers or teachers. </p>
        <p> The main takeaway is that all jobs employ a level of knowledge in ADS since everything in computer science is algorithms and data structures. </p>
