            <br>

            <p>Currently, West University of Timisoara features several related courses: CA (Computer Architecture), 
                FLAT (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and many more related to the field disciplines. 
                See <a href="https://info.uvt.ro/programe-licenta/informatica-engleza/" class="custom-link" target="_blank"><em>Curriculum</em>
                </a>The subjects examined at the university deeply cover many logical and practical subtleties, 
                allowing graduates to attain high-level skills and competencies. As a 1st-year student who finished the CA course taught 
                by professor Cristian Cira, the theoretical material and practical labs (CTF challenges) introduced 
                me and my colleagues to this versatile field, 
                emphasizing main concepts and contemporary design features. It gave a good grasp for a newcomer student, 
                eager to work in the embedded systems domain.</p>
