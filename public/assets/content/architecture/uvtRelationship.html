            <p>Currently, <b>West University of Timisoara</b> features several related courses: <b>CA</b> (Computer Architecture),
                FLAT (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and many more related to the field disciplines. 
                See <a href="https://info.uvt.ro/programe-licenta/informatica-engleza/" class="custom-link" target="_blank"><em>Curriculum</em>
                </a>
                <br>
                The subjects examined at the university deeply cover many logical and practical subtleties,
                allowing graduates to attain high-level skills and competencies.
                <br/>
                As a 1st-year student who finished the CA course taught
                by professor <b>Cristian Cira</b>, the theoretical material and practical labs (CTF challenges) introduced
                me and my colleagues to this versatile field, 
                emphasizing main concepts and contemporary design features.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It gave a good grasp for a newcomer student,
                eager to work in the embedded systems domain.</p>
