                <b>Computer Architecture and Organization</b> is the foundation of the field of Computer Science. Its origins lay back to the mid of 20th century when resources were tens of thousand times more modest in comparison to nowadays.

                One of the pioneers of the Computer Science domain is <b>John von Neumann</b>, who is best known known for his work in the early development of computers. John von Neumann introduced an architecture design in 1945, that has been applied since then in almost every electronic device. On a large scale, its ability to treat instructions as data is what makes assemblers, compilers, linkers, loaders, and other automated programming tools possible. The architecture allowed "programs that write programs" along with studies of Formal Languages and Automata Theory. This has made a sophisticated computing ecosystem flourish around von Neumann architecture machines.

                To reduce cost and size of early fragile and expensive switches used in early computation era, such as vacuum tubes, as well as to increase reliability and speed, a radical new electronic switch was needed. In 1947 the group of scientists invented a transistor, that was a turning point in computational organization. Moore's law demonstrated how the number of tiny devices called transistors doubles every two years. Nowadays, current CPUs designs comprise billions and trillions of transistors that work at near light speed, being extremely fast and energy-efficient.
