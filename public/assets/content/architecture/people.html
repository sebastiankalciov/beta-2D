            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4 font-bold">John von Neumann</h3>
            <p>
                The von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a 
                computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann, and by others, 
                in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. The document describes a design architecture for 
                an electronic digital computer with these components:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>A processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers</li>
                <li>A control unit that includes an instruction register and a program counter</li>
                <li>Memory that stores data and instructions</li>
                <li>Input and output mechanisms</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4 font-bold">Gordon Moore</h3>
            <p>
                The observation that the number of transistors on computer chips 
                doubles approximately every two years is known as Moore’s Law. 
                Moore’s Law is not a law of nature, but an observation of a long-term 
                trend in how technology is changing. The law was first described by 
                Gordon E. Moore, the co-founder of Intel, in 1965.

            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4 font-bold">Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, and William Shockley</h3>
            <p>
                The invention of the transistor marked a significant milestone in electronics, 
                paving the way for modern electronic devices and earning the trio the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956.
                Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, and William Shockley were the inventors of the transistor, 
                a revolutionary solid-state device.
                A spokesman claimed that "it may have far-reaching significance in electronics and 
                electrical communication." 
                Despite its delicate mechanical construction, many thousands of units were 
                produced in a metal cartridge package as the Bell Labs "Type A" transistor.

            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4 font-bold">John Hannesy</h3>
            <p>
                A pioneer of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture. He co-authored the 
                influential textbook "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" with 
                David Patterson and later served as the President of Stanford University.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4 font-bold">Seymour Cray</h3>
            <p>
                Known as the "father of supercomputing," he founded Cray Research and 
                designed a series of innovative supercomputers that set performance records for decades.
