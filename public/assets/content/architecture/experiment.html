                One of the widely-studied parts of computer engineering is designing energy-efficient and 
                productive CPUs and GPUs, working at multicore levels. Some of the current projects like Apple's M-series chips 
                involve heterogeneous computing principles, that allow combining different types of cores (CPUs and GPUs) 
                within one small chip. This approach allows for better optimization of performance and power efficiency 
                for specific workloads.

                Another good example of current design trends is life-support devices or spectrum analyzing machines 
                for medical discoveries and healthcare. IBM Summit Supercomputer for COVID-19 Research is specifically 
                designed for high-performance computing, featuring over 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs and IBM Power9 CPUs interconnected 
                with high-speed links. The computer architecture of Summit enables it to perform complex simulations and data 
                analysis tasks required for medical research.

                Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has developed its own custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) computer, 
                which is at the heart of its autonomous driving technology. 
                Designed with automotive-grade reliability and energy efficiency in mind, the Tesla FSD 
                computer integrates multiple processing cores, hardware accelerators for AI inference, 
                and specialized I/O interfaces for sensor data fusion.

                In the field of bioinformatics, the development of specialized processors for DNA sequencing 
                has been a significant advancement. These processors are designed to handle the vast amounts 
                of data generated during sequencing and to perform complex computations quickly. For example, 
                the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks platform leverages GPUs to accelerate genomic analysis, reducing 
                the time required for tasks such as variant calling and genome assembly.

                Algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing computer architecture and organization. 
                Techniques such as parallel computing and distributed systems are extensively researched 
                to improve the performance of large-scale computations. The use of machine learning algorithms 
                to predict and manage workloads in data centers is another cutting-edge area. Google's Tensor 
                Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed accelerators for machine learning workloads, 
                showcasing the intersection of algorithm design and specialized hardware.

                In computational science, experiments with quantum computing are pushing the boundaries of traditional 
                computer architecture. Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) and leverage principles of 
                quantum mechanics to perform computations at unprecedented speeds for specific problems. 
                Companies like IBM and Google are leading the way in developing quantum processors, which have 
                the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, material science, and complex system simulations.
