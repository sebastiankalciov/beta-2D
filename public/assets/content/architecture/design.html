            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4">What is Computer Architecture?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Computer architecture is the arrangement of the components that comprise a computer system and 
                the engine at the core of the processes that drive its functioning. It specifies the 
                machine interface for which programming languages and associated processors are designed.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Complex instruction set computer (CISC) and reduced instruction set computer (RISC) are the two predominant approaches to the architecture that influence how computer processors function.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>CISC</strong> processors have one processing unit, auxiliary memory, and a tiny register set containing hundreds of unique commands. These processors execute a task with a single instruction, making a programmer’s work simpler since fewer lines of code are required to complete the operation. This method utilizes less memory but may need more time to execute instructions.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                A reassessment led to the creation of high-performance computers based on the <strong>RISC</strong> architecture. The hardware is designed to be as basic and swift as possible, and sophisticated instructions can be executed with simpler ones.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl mt-4">How Computer Architecture works?</h3>
            <br>    
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose of computer architecture:</strong> Everything a system performs, from online surfing to printing, involves the transmission and processing of numbers. A computer's architecture is merely a mathematical system intended to collect, transmit, and interpret numbers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Manipulating data:</strong> The computer manages information using numerical operations. It is possible to display an image on a screen by transferring a matrix of digits to the video memory, with every number reflecting a pixel of color.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Booting up:</strong> At the most elementary level of a computer design, programs are executed by the processor whenever the computer is switched on. These programs configure the computer’s proper functioning and initialize the different hardware sub-components to a known state.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Support for temporary storage:</strong> Memory is also a vital component of computer architecture, with several types often present in a single system. The memory is used to hold programs (applications) while they are being executed by the processor and the data being processed by the programs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Support for permanent storage:</strong> There can also be tools for storing data or sending information to the external world as part of the computer system. These provide text inputs through the keyboard, the presentation of knowledge on a monitor, and the transfer of programs and data from or to a disc drive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>User-facing functionality:</strong> Software governs the operation and functioning of a computer. Several software ‘layers’ exist in computer architecture. Typically, a layer would only interface with layers below or above it.
