                Naming convention:
                    folder_names: [ai-robotics, algorithms, architecture, bioinformatics, computational-science,
                    databases, graphics, human-computer, organizational-informatics, os, programming-languages, software engineering]

                    sections: [connections, design, experiment, people, problems, theory, uvtRelationship, venues]
                
                Each folder contains the sections mentioned before.

                Each section is a different html file.
