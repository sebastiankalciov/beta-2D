                <h3>The Future of Bioinformatics</h3>
                <p style = "color: black;">The late 20th century witnessed the emergence of computers in biology. Their use, along with continuously improving laboratory technology, has permitted increasingly complex research endeavors. Whereas sequencing a single protein or gene could have been the subject of a doctoral thesis up to the early 1990s, a PhD student may now analyze the collective genome of many microbial communities during his/her graduate studies. Whereas determining the primary structure of a protein was complex back then, one can now identify the whole proteome of a sample. Biology has now embraced a holistic approach, but within distinct macromolecular classes (e.g. genomics, proteomics and glycomics) with little crosstalk between each subdiscipline.</p>
                <p style = "color: black;">One may anticipate the next leap: instead of independently investigating whole genomes, whole transcriptomes or whole metabolomes, whole living organisms and their environments will be computationally modeled, with all molecular categories taken into account simultaneously. In fact, this feat has already been achieved in a whole cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium, in which all its genes, their products and their known metabolic interactions have been reconstructed in silico. Perhaps we will soon witness an in silico model of a whole pluricellular organism. Even though this might seem unfeasible to model millions to trillions of cells, one must keep in mind that we are now achieving research exploits that would have been deemed as computationally or technically impossible even 10 years ago.</p>
