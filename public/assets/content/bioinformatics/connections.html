                <p>Bioinformatics is a discipline that is dependent on other areas of both Biology and Computer Science. It is heavily influenced by the developments from the following Computer Science areas:</p>

                    <div class="extra-text">
                        <p>As new programming languages emerge, the software for bioinformatics is following the trend. From assembly language, to Python, Perl and R, the developers of bioinformatics tools are constantly looking towards new developments in the programming languages field.</p>

                        <p>
                            In order to develop algorithms to analyse biological data, it is essential to use data structures such as graphs, arrays, hash tables, etc. </p>

                        <p>
                            Computer architecture is responsible for the fast computational power that we have today. Bioinformatics relies on the advances in this field to be able to analyse more and more data in a shorter time.</p>

                            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have had a great contribution to Bioinformatics, helping scientists to shape predictive models for disease diagnosis and predicting the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.</p>

                            Visualising bioinformatics data allows researchers to gain insight into their data that is not obvious from simple descriptive statistics. Graphic representations are used in a variety of bioinformatics tools, such as CN3D, PyMOL and RasMol.</p>
