                <h3>Biological Databases</h3>

                <p>Biological databases are archives of biological data, including genetic and protein sequences, annotations, pathways, and disease information. These databases are used for the storage and organisation of data in a way that allows easy retrieval of information.</p>
            
                <p>Biological databases can be classified into the following three types based on their contents:</p>
        
                <div class="leftbox">
                <h4>Primary Databases</h4>
                <p>Primary databases are collections of unprocessed biological data, consisting of raw sequences or structural information. These databases are repositories of original information and are not modified in any way. Examples of primary databases include GenBank, PDB, and DDBJ.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="middlebox">
                <h4>Secondary Databases</h4>
                <p>Secondary databases contain information that has been processed or curated using computational or manual methods. The information in these databases is based on the original data from primary databases. Examples of secondary databases include PIR, SWISS-PROT, and Pfam.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="rightbox">
                <h4>Specialised Databases</h4>
                <p>Specialized databases are databases that are designed to serve a specific research interest. These databases are created with a particular focus on a specific organism or type of data. Examples of specialized databases include Flybase, the HIV sequence database, and the Ribosomal Database Project.</p>
                </div>
