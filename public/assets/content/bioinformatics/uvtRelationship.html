            <p>The role of a bioinformatics scientist is to develop and apply computational tools and algorithms to analyze, manage, and interpret large biological datasets.
            </p>

            <p>The International Society for Computational Biology published guidelines and recommendations of core competencies that a bioinformatician should have in her/his curriculum, based on three user categories (bioinformatics user, bioinformatics scientist and bioinformatics engineer). All three user categories contain core competencies such as:
            </p>

            <p style="color: brown;"><i>‘[using] current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computational biology practice’, ‘[applying] statistical research methods in the contexts of molecular biology, genomics, medical, and population genetics research’ and ‘knowledge of general biology, in-depth knowledge of at least one area of biology, and understanding of biological data generation technologies’.</i></p>

<p>Additional competencies were defined for the remaining two categories, such as:
    <i style="color: brown;">‘[analysing] a problem and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution’ for the bioinformatics scientist, and ‘[applying] mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modelling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices’ for the bioinformatics engineer’.</i></p>

    <p>The general path to becoming a bioinformatician seems to look like this:</p>
