                HCI relies heavily on laboratories and often stimulates new developments in computer design. 
                Therefore, when it comes to Human-Computer Interaction, models and associated measurements are critical.

                CAD represents the use of computer systems in order to create, modify, optimize a design.
                The main purpose of this software is to increase the designer's productivity, while also
                improving the quality of the design and creating a database for manufacturing. The output
                of CAD is usually in the form of electronic files.

                Sophisticated image processing and methods for enhancement have been developed to allow the
                interpretation of photographs from deep-space probes to human CT and MRI scans.

                Experimental studies led to the deduction of principles for designing displays and control 
                panels for resistance to human misinterpretation.
