            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b> • Artificial Intelligence:</b> AI techniques can be used to create user interfaces
                that adapt to the user's behaviors and preferences, as well as enable the development
                of chatbots and voice-controlled interfaces.

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b> • Robotics:</b> HCI principles are used for interacting with robots, making them more
                user-friendly, while also having them respond to human social cues, thus improving their
                integration into human environments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b> • Software Engineering:</b> engineering contributes to HCI by optimizing performance and 
                user experience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b> • Graphics:</b> HCI research helps the design of GUI's that are visually appealing and 
                interactive visualizations that help users understand data that's more complex.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b> • Information Retrieval:</b> HCI helps design search interfaces that improve an user's 
                ability of efficiently finding information.

                <b> • Cognitive sciences:</b> these sciences study how the mind works, proving to be essential
                in designing interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b> • Psychology:</b> crucial for designing interfaces that meet users' needs and preferences.
