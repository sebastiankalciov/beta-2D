                Represents the main focus of the field. Designers are concerned with building systems that
                meet clear specifications and satisfy their customers. They boast many significant accomplishments.

                In manufacturing (and computer chip design), CAD systems are still the most commonly used, and smaller
                versions of these systems are accessible for one's personal computer. The user interface design area has
                seen a lot of progress, now using icons and menus for display and a mouse for the input device, setting 
                a popular standard to be followed.

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                However, it does not stop here as modern interfaces are now revolving around computers controlled using
                 graphic tablets or voice input.

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                DIS systems are usually used in defense applications to train people how to handle
                battlefield situations. These systems allow users to interact with one another, as
                well as their environment, over a network, by presenting a real-time image of the 
                world seen from the participant's perspective.
