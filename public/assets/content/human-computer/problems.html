                <b>1. Learnability:</b> creating designs that comply with the conventions of other similar ones,
                making them predictable in navigation and overall layout, to make it easier for the 
                user to understand how to use it. In these cases, simplicity is key. A usability test
                may be used on the same user at a certain interval, testing how memorable the
                application is. Feedback can then be used to increase the chances of success on the market.

                <b>2. Meaningful human control:</b> defined as one of the short-term research priorities for AI.
                This is a principle that has to do with humans, not computers, supporting the fact that in the
                end, we will be morally responsible for actions mediated by autonomous systems. Important features
                are transparency, accountability, building trust between the user and the system.

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b>3. Humane digital experience:</b> creating a technology that supports individual and social life,
                respects human rights, incorporates human values in the design choices, enabling humans to exploit 
                their potential (creative, social or economic).

                <b>4. Adaptation to human needs:</b> making the intelligent environments act and support humans by
                providing personalized, insightful, responsive services.

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b>5. Emotion detection:</b> since humans are emotional beings, an important challenge for optimizing
                human-computer interaction is working out how technology can express emotions, as it has the potential
                to affect humans psychologically.

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                <b>6. Human safety:</b> the development of intelligent systems that have the potential to self-evolve
                come with some risk due to technology misuse or poor design. Therefore, the systems should be “safe-by-design”.
