                Please do NOT modify anything from the style attribute from this file
                In the actual project, this file does not contain the style and script attributes, this is just a template.

                Naming convention:
                    folder_names: [ai-robotics, algorithms, architecture, bioinformatics, computational-science,
                    databases, graphics, human-computer, organizational-informatics, os, programming-languages, software engineering]

                    sections: [connections, design, experiment, people, problems, theory, uvtRelationship, venues]
                
                Each folder contains the sections mentioned before.

                Each section is a different html file.

                Please try to structure your research in this manner.

<h3>What is computational science?</h3>
    <p>Alongside theory and experiment, computation is considered to be the third approach to science, it being used to solve hard problems, sometimes referred to as “grand challenges” (e.g., demonstrating existence of certain quarks, numerical simulation of the air flow field around an airplane in flight, joining DNA sequence fragments into the full human genome, microscopy, tomography, crystallography, and protein folding).</p>
    <p>Computational science is an interdisciplinary field which deals with studying problems in science and engineering that require high-performance computation and communications. It deals with general methods of efficiently and accurately solving equations resulting from mathematical models of physical systems, for example: airflow around wings, water flow around obstacles, petroleum flow in earth's crust, plasma flow from stars, weather progression, and galactic collisions.</p>
    <p>Computational science makes great use of mathematics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>number theory deals with finite, binary representations of numbers and error propagation in arithmetic calculations;</li>
        <li>linear algebra deals with solving systems of linear equations that are expressed as matrices;</li>
        <li>nonlinear dynamics deals with chaotic systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Supporting mathematics include: calculus, real analysis, complex analysis, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra.</p>
    <p>Other supporting theory: parallel algorithms, optimizing compilers, distributed computation, organization of large data sets, automatic discovery in data, computational geometry, graphics (often, in this context, called scientific visualization), statistics.</p>
