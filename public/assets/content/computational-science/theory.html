        <h1 class = "text-4xl font-bold">What is computational science?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Alongside theory and experiment, computation is considered to be the third approach to science,
            it being used to solve hard problems, sometimes referred to as “<b>grand challenges</b>”:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>demonstrating existence of certain quarks</b></li>
            <li><b>numerical simulation of the air flow field around an airplane in flight</b></li>
            <li><b>joining DNA sequence fragments into the full human genome</b></li>
            <li><b>microscopy</b></li>
            <li><b>tomography</b></li>
            <li><b>crystallography</b></li>
            <li><b>protein folding</b></li>
        </ul>

        <br/>
        <p><b>Computational science</b> is an interdisciplinary field which deals with studying problems in science and engineering that require high-performance computation and communications.
            <br/>
            It deals with general methods of efficiently and accurately solving equations resulting from mathematical models of physical systems, for example: airflow around wings, water flow around obstacles, petroleum flow in earth's crust, plasma flow from stars, weather progression, and galactic collisions.</p>

        <br/>
        <h1 class = "text-xl font-bold">Computational science makes great use of mathematics:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>number theory deals with finite, binary representations of numbers and error propagation in arithmetic calculations;</li>
            <li>linear algebra deals with solving systems of linear equations that are expressed as matrices;</li>
            <li>nonlinear dynamics deals with chaotic systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Supporting mathematics include: calculus, real analysis, complex analysis, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra.</p>
        <p>Other supporting theory: parallel algorithms, optimizing compilers, distributed computation, organization of large data sets, automatic discovery in data, computational geometry, graphics (often, in this context, called scientific visualization), statistics.</p>
