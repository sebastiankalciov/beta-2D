                Please do NOT modify anything from the style attribute from this file
                In the actual project, this file does not contain the style and script attributes, this is just a template.

                Naming convention:
                    folder_names: [ai-robotics, algorithms, architecture, bioinformatics, computational-science,
                    databases, graphics, human-computer, organizational-informatics, os, programming-languages, software engineering]

                    sections: [connections, design, experiment, people, problems, theory, uvtRelationship, venues]
                
                Each folder contains the sections mentioned before.

                Each section is a different html file.

                Please try to structure your research in this manner.

    <ul>
        <li><img src="../assets/content/computational-science/johnVon.jpg" style="width:250px;height:300px">
	<strong>John von Neumann</strong>, often considered the father of modern computing, developed the architecture of digital computers, known as the von Neumann architecture, which describes a system where a computer's program and the data it processes are stored in the same memory.</li>
        <li><img src="../assets/content/computational-science/turing.jpg" style="width:250px;height:300px">
	<strong>Alan Turing</strong>, he was a pioneer in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. His concept of the Turing machine provided a formal foundation for the theory of computation and algorithms. He also played a crucial role in breaking the Enigma code during World War II.</li>
        <li><img src="../assets/content/computational-science/knuth.jpg" style="width:250px;height:300px">
	<strong>Donald Knuth</strong>, best known as the author of “The Art of Computer Programming,” also developed the TeX typesetting system.</li>
        <li><img src="../assets/content/computational-science/valiant.jpg" style="width:250px;height:300px">
	<strong>Leslie Valiant</strong> is known for his work in computational complexity theory, particularly the theory of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning, which is fundamental to machine learning and artificial intelligence.</li>
        <li><img src="../assets/content/computational-science/tim.jpg" style="width:250px;height:300px">
	<strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> is the inventor of the World Wide Web, which revolutionized how information is shared and accessed across the globe.</li>
