        <h3 class = "text-4xl">Uses of computational science:</h3>
        <p>Computational science has led scientists to creating many useful systems such as: Chem, Web, Linpack, Eispack, Ellpack, Macsyma, Mathematica, Maple, and Reduce. They have also contributed models and algorithms in a multitude of other fields, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>physics (e.g., demonstrating existence of certain quarks)</li>
            <li>aerodynamics and flow dynamics (e.g., numerical simulation of the air flow field around an airplane in flight)</li>
            <li>chemistry (e.g., designing enzymes and proteins that selectively attack viruses)</li>
            <li>biology (e.g., joining DNA sequence fragments into the full human genome, microscopy, tomography, crystallography, and protein folding)</li>
            <li>geology (e.g., predicting earthquakes)</li>
            <li>astronomy (e.g., locating the missing mass of the universe)</li>
            <li>meteorology (e.g., long term weather forecasting)</li>
            <li>engineering (e.g., interaction between control surfaces and dynamic stress movements in structures)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many of these “grand challenges” have been solved thanks to the support offered by the USA.</p>
        <h3>Important conferences and journals in computational science:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS), first held in 2001, and has been organized yearly ever since</li>
            <li>The Journal of Computational Science, published in 2010</li>
            <li>The Journal of Open Research Software, launched in 2012</li>
            <li>The ReScience C initiative, started on GitHub in 2015</li>
        </ul>
