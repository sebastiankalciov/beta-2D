                Please do NOT modify anything from the style attribute from this file
                In the actual project, this file does not contain the style and script attributes, this is just a template.

                Naming convention:
                    folder_names: [ai-robotics, algorithms, architecture, bioinformatics, computational-science,
                    databases, graphics, human-computer, organizational-informatics, os, programming-languages, software engineering]

                    sections: [connections, design, experiment, people, problems, theory, uvtRelationship, venues]
                
                Each folder contains the sections mentioned before.

                Each section is a different html file.

                Please try to structure your research in this manner.

<h3>Uses of computational science:</h3>
    <p>Computational science has led scientists to creating many useful systems such as: Chem, Web, Linpack, Eispack, Ellpack, Macsyma, Mathematica, Maple, and Reduce. They have also contributed models and algorithms in a multitude of other fields, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>physics (e.g., demonstrating existence of certain quarks)</li>
        <li>aerodynamics and flow dynamics (e.g., numerical simulation of the air flow field around an airplane in flight)</li>
        <li>chemistry (e.g., designing enzymes and proteins that selectively attack viruses)</li>
        <li>biology (e.g., joining DNA sequence fragments into the full human genome, microscopy, tomography, crystallography, and protein folding)</li>
        <li>geology (e.g., predicting earthquakes)</li>
        <li>astronomy (e.g., locating the missing mass of the universe)</li>
        <li>meteorology (e.g., long term weather forecasting)</li>
        <li>engineering (e.g., interaction between control surfaces and dynamic stress movements in structures)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many of these “grand challenges” have been solved thanks to the support offered by the USA.</p>

    <h3>Important conferences and journals in computational science:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS), first held in 2001, and has been organized yearly ever since</li>
        <li>The Journal of Computational Science, published in 2010</li>
        <li>The Journal of Open Research Software, launched in 2012</li>
        <li>The ReScience C initiative, started on GitHub in 2015</li>
    </ul>
