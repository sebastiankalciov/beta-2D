            <h1>What is software engineering?</h1>
            <p>
                IEEE<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> defines software engineering as
            </p>
            <p>
                "The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software".
            </p>
            <p>
                Software engineering is not just <i>designing and developing software</i>. It is rather an <i>engineering approach</i> to develop software <sup>[<a href="#mall2018fundamentals">1</a>]</sup>.
            </p>

            <h1>Activities in software engineering</h1>
            <p>
                Denning in [<a href="#denning2000computer">2</a>] describes three major activities (or <i>paradigms</i>) carried out in all areas of computer science: <b>theory</b>, <b>experimentation</b> and <b>design</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>
                Theories offer common explanations and understanding of basic concepts and underlying mechanisms, and thus they are essential for knowledge of passing trends and the reason for their manifestation<sup>[<a href="#hannaysestematic">3</a>]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the usefulness of theories in software engineering is a subject of debate, as [<a href="#hannaysestematic">2</a>] very well explains, <i>building theories is a means to go beyond the mere observation of phenomena, and to try to understand <b>why</b> and <b>how</b> these phenomena occur</i>.
            </p>

            <h3>Topics of research</h3>
            <p>
                A systematic analysis on research in the area of software engineering conducted in [<a href="#glass2002research">4</a>] suggests that the main topics of research are:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Software and software systems concepts, particularly:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Methods and techniques, such as design patterns, parallel processing, etc.;</li>
                                <li>Software development tools, for instance compilers, debuggers and linters;</li>
                                <li>Software development life cycle stages, software engineering process models (methodologies, e.g. <i>agile, RAD, waterfall, DevOps etc.</i>);</li>
                                <li>Software quality assurance, through benchmarking to measure performance and through implementation of fault tolerance;</li>
                            </ul>
                    <li> Software and software system management concepts, for instance:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Development and use of software measurement methods;</li>
                            <li>Project and product management, including the process of risk management;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Computer networks and distributed systems;</li>
                    <li>Database organization and information retrieval;</li>
                    <li>Problem-solving methodologies; and others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Research methods</h3>
                <p>
                    [<a href="#glass1994software">5</a>] identifies research models used in the field of software engineering. These are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <b>Scientific method</b>, where the world is observed, and a model, based on the observation, is built.
                        <br>
                        This method is typically used in applied areas, where simulations must be made in order to evaluate performance, e.g. telecommunication networks<sup>[<a href="#wohlin2012experimentation">6</a>]</sup>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>Engineering method</b>, where current solutions are studied, possible modifications are proposed, and then evaluated.
                        <br>
                        Engineering methods may also use simulations as a means for conducting experiments. The engineering method of research is the most dominant in the area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>Empirical method</b>, in which a model is proposed, then applied to case studies for assessment and validation.
                        <br>
                        This method has been gaining popularity over the past decade. In fact, empirical software engineering has grown so popular that it is now considered a subfield of software engineering.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>Analytical method</b>, in which a formal theory or a set of axioms is proposed, then results are derived, which can then be compared with empirical observations.
                        <br>
                        This method is tradionally used in more theory-intensive, formal areas of computer science, e.g. algorithms<sup>[<a href="#wohlin2012experimentation">6</a>]</sup>.
                    </li>
