            <h1>Connection to other areas of Computer Science</h1>
                <p>
                    Software engineering can be described as an application of all computer science fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way or another, during the process of software development, competencies and knowledge from another field of computer science will be used, whether that be algorithms and data structures or human-computer interaction. Some fields have more impact on the process of software development than others. A list follows.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Computer Engineering</b>
                        <br>
                        At times, low-level knowledge is required; meaning the software engineer must modify the product design accordingly, in order to match the capabilities of the average machine running the product.
                        For instance, a software product for mobile phones is designed much differently than one made for computers, due to their different architectures and computing limits.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <b>Mathematics</b>
                        <br>
                        As mathematics is closely related to computer science, it is also related to a field of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data Science and Engineering, Data Analysis</b>
                        <br>
                        At times, the development of a software product requires statistical research and data collection. More commonly, with the release of a software product to users, data collection begins, which is then analysed by software engineers to use in the maintenance, improvement phase of the process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Database Engineering</b>
                        <br>
                        Designing data-intensive applications is not trivial. Data retrieval, modification and storage are all processes used in today's software systems, and thus they must be conducted efficiently.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Connection to other areas outside of Computer Science</h1>
                <p>
                    The use of technology and software has been implemented in many domains. Of course, to develop a software product for use in a particular fields (e.g. medical, manufacturing, agriculture, etc.), a software engineer will require competences related to that field, in order to understand the client's needs and specifications better, and to optimize user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software engineering as a discipline encompasses competences outside of computer science, thus we shall list related disciplines with competences similar to those in software engineering, as presented in [<a href="#swebokv3">13</a>] as well as [<a href="#denning2000computer">2</a>].
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Project management, Team management, Management Science</b>
                        <br>
                        The development of a software product is a big project, and during the development lifecycle of software, software engineers must be capable to manage a team effectively. The primary goal of a software engineer is to have a quality software product developed as soon as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Psychology, Cognitive and Behavioral sciences</b>
                        <br>
                        During the design phase of a software product, a software engineer must keep the user in mind: Is this interface simple enough for the user? In cases where the software product is used in emergency situations, is its interface designed well so that it can be used in such situations of increased stress? and many other questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Economics</b>
                        <br>
                        The cost of the software development process must also be kept in mind. Resources, in the form of people (developers, designers, etc.) as well as in the material form (machines, power supply, etc.) can become costly if they are not taken into consideration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
