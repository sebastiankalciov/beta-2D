                The design activity in software engineering has to do with <em>designing</em> as well as <em>implementing/building</em> software that support work in given organizations or application domains<sup>[<a href="#denning2000computer">2</a>]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since software engineering is primarily a design specialty, the majority of those in the area of software engineering deal with design rather than theory and experimentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                We shall separate the design activity into <em>design</em> and <em>development</em>, as they represent two separate fields of software engineering thus their distinction is clear.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="par-title">Designing software.</span> "<cite>Software design is the <em>purposeful conception</em> of a [software] product and the <em>planning for its production</em></cite><sup>[<a href="#Taylor2019">2</a>]</sup>"
                <br>
                It is concerned with both the internal and the external design of a software system.
            </p>
            <p class="par-with-title">
                <span class="par-title">External design of a software product.</span> External design defines the features of the product <em>what the product can do</em> and how it interacts with the users and its environment. It determines how well the product satisfies the client's specifications (and thus the user's desires)<sup>[<a href="#Taylor2019">2</a>]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="par-with-title">
                <span class="par-title">Internal design of a software product.</span> Internal design defines how the aforementioned external features work, and determines many attributes of the product's functionality, such as its performance and reliability.
                <br>
                A critical attribute determined by the internal design of a software product is its evolution: how it can evolve to meet users' changing needs<sup>[<a href="#Taylor2019">2</a>]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="par-with-title">
                <span class="par-title">Software architecture.</span> The architecture of a software system is a set of fundamental design choices, which Taylor in [<a href="#Taylor2019">2</a>] calls the "<cite>principal decisions</cite>". The architecture of a software system is fundamental to its conceptual integrity<sup>[<a href="#Taylor2019">2</a>]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p class="par-with-title">
                <span class="par-title">Developing software.</span> Software development is defined by [<a href="#imbWhatSoftware">2</a>] as a sub-field of software engineering that deals with creating, designing<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, deploying and maintaining software.
                <br>
                Compared to software engineers, software developers have a less formal role in the process of software engineering. They are involved in the practical side of things; working with various teams involved in specific project areas to transform specifications into features, and conducting software testing and maintenance.
            </p>
            <p class="par-with-title">
                <span class="par-title">A common misconception.</span> As one reading this article may have realized, software engineering is not just programming, testing and debugging. Before the software developers even begin coding, a lot of thought is put into the design of the product (<em>a work of software designers and software architects</em>), as well as the intricate mechanics with which all of the system's modules communicate with one another.
                <br>
                Thus, <b>the work of a software developer is not comparable to that of a software engineer</b>, but rather <em>software development is a subset of software engineering</em>, <em>a stage in the process of software engineering</em>.
