                In software engineering, experimentation is a means of evaluating and choosing between various methods, techniques, languages (<i>formal, programming</i>) and tools before using them in later software development processes. It also enables understanding, identifying and verifying relationships between different factors, different variables in a process<sup>[<a href="#wohlin2012experimentation">6</a>]</sup>. 
            </p>
            <h2>Purpose of experimentation</h2>
            <p>
                Experiments may be used in various contexts, such as<sup>[<a href="#wohlin2012experimentation">6</a>]</sup>:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to confirm theories;</li>
                    <li>to confirm common conceptions about a topic;</li>
                    <li>to explore relationships between different factors and variables;</li>
                    <li>to verify the accuracy of models;</li>
                    <li>to validate measures.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Through experimentation, claims (i.e. <em>theories</em>) can be investigated in order to determine in which situations they hold, as well as to determine contexts in which certain standards, methods and tools are suitable to use.
            </p>
            <h2>Classification of experiments</h2>
            <p>
                Experiments may be <i>human-oriented</i>, where humans apply different treatments to objects, or <i>technology-oriented</i>, where different tools are applied to different objects<sup>[<a href="#wohlin2012experimentation">6</a>]</sup>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An example of a human-oriented experiment is one where multiple subjects are asked to inspect a piece of code, as an evaluation of inspection methods.</li>
                <li>An example of a technology-oriented experiment is one where multiple sorting algorithms are applied to the same sorting problem, as a means of assessing their corectness and performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Theory in experimentation</h2>
                <p>
                    Experiments are suitable for <i>causal description</i>, i.e. "describing the consequence attributable to deliberately varying a treatment<sup>[<a href="#hannaysestematic">3</a>]</sup>".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experiments, however, only provide a <i>description</i> rather than an <i>explanation</i>.
                    The desire for a <i>causal explanation</i> leads to the development of theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theories clarify the mechanisms through which, as well as the conditions under which a phenomenon occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of theory, however, is scarce in software engineering, as concluded by [<a href="#hannaysestematic">3</a>].
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Perhaps this is one of the reasons many exclude the field when mentioning engineering sciences, as well as the reason why it is still a maturing field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, with the substantial growth empirical software engineering in the past decade, usage of empirical research methods is becoming more of a common practice, and thus less and less theoretical elements are used in research, in favor of simulations, case studies and other techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As  [<a href="#wohlin2012experimentation">6</a>] very well states, "<cite>theory building in software engineering should be developed, in order for the field to develop into a mature field of science</cite>".
