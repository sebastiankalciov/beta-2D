                The foundations of programming languages are firmly based in discrete mathematics, logic, and formal languages. Essential mathematical concepts in this context include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Predicate Logic: For formal program reasoning.</li>
                <li>Temporal Logic: For reasoning about time-dependent behaviors.</li>
                <li>Modern Algebra: For structuring and manipulating programming constructs.</li>
                <li>Mathematical Induction: For proving properties of programs.</li>
            </ul>
