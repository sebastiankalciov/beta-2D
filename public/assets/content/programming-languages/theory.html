                The field of programming languages theory examines machines' models that produce and interpret languages as well as grammars for representing legitimate strings within those languages. Instances consist of formal language models and automata, Turing machines, lambda-calculus and propositional logic. The theory focuses on semantics, examining the connections between language strings and virtual machine states.

                A programming language includes syntax and semantics, and more broadly, it also includes a standard library and an ecosystem. The standard library offers a range of tools needed for applications, including data structures such as lists and maps, functions for managing file and network input/output, and more. Programmers also consider the programming language's ecosystem to be crucial. The language ecosystem consists of developers, companies, third-party libraries, and other related components.
